# Automated-eCommerce-Data-Mapping-System
Streamlining product data transformation for seamless eCommerce integration

🚀 Overview
Managing and syndicating product data across multiple eCommerce platforms can be time-consuming and error-prone. Many businesses struggle with manual data mapping, inconsistent attributes, and integration issues when aligning their product catalogs with marketplace requirements.

This project automates the data transformation and mapping process using Python (Pandas, NumPy) and SQL, ensuring high accuracy, reduced validation time, and improved data consistency. The system efficiently maps, cleans, and validates large-scale product datasets, enabling businesses to optimize their Product Information Management (PIM) workflow.

🔥 Key Highlights

📊 Automated Data Transformation – Converts raw product data into structured formats for seamless integration.
⚡ API-Based Product Syndication – Uses REST/GraphQL APIs to fetch and push data across eCommerce platforms.
🔍 Data Cleaning & Validation – Ensures high accuracy (99%+) by handling missing values, duplicates, and incorrect mappings.
💡 SQL-Driven Data Processing – Uses PostgreSQL/MySQL queries for efficient data extraction, filtering, and transformation.
📉 Reduced Manual Effort – Automates attribute mapping and validation, reducing manual work by 35%.
📈 Improved Efficiency – Cuts validation time by 30% and enhances data accuracy for eCommerce syndication.
